Report on Police Shootings Across States and Cities in the U.S
Questions I Sought to Answer
While analyzing the dataset on police shootings across the United States, I focused on uncovering patterns, trends, and social implications tied to these incidents. 

The key questions that guided my analysis were:
1. How many people have been killed in police shootings over the years?
2. Which races and genders have been most affected?
3. What is the trend of police shootings over time — is it increasing, declining, or stagnant?
4. How prevalent are police body cameras in these shootings?
5. How are victims distributed across states and cities?
6. What is the typical manner of death (e.g., gunshot, taser)?
7. How do victims tend to flee (or not) when these incidents occur?

Key Insights and Findings
After cleaning and analyzing the dataset in Power BI, here’s a summary of my major findings:

1. Total Victims and Spread
A total of 4,895 victims were recorded in the dataset.
These incidents span 2,287 cities and 51 states, indicating a nationwide issue.
6 racial groups were represented, with sharp disparities across them.

2. Racial Distribution
The majority of victims were White and Black, with the Black population being disproportionately affected relative to their national population percentage.
Hispanics/Latinos followed next, with significantly fewer victims from other racial groups.

3. Gender Analysis
A vast majority of the victims were male, which raises deeper questions about police perceptions, confrontation patterns, and perhaps risk profiling.

4. Body Camera Availability
In nearly 88% of all incidents, police did not have body cameras on. This reflects poorly on accountability efforts and limits the availability of objective video evidence in fatal encounters.

6. Flee Behavior
While some victims attempted to flee by vehicle, foot, or other means, a majority were either not fleeing or the status wasn’t recorded. This raises concerns about justification in some use-of-force decisions.

8. Trends Over Time
A yearly trend analysis showed fluctuations, with some years seeing spikes in fatalities. However, there wasn’t a consistent downward trend until after 2019 to 2020.

8. State-by-State Impact
States like Carlifonia (CA), Texas (TX), and Florida (FL) recorded notably high numbers of victims, though the reasons behind the spikes in specific states may need further research. 

Conclusion
This report highlights deep and persistent issues in the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve. From racial disparities and lack of body camera usage, the Power BI dashboard served as a visual tool to bring these patterns to light.
